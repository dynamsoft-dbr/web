## Overview
Dynamsoft's Barcode Reader is a recognition SDK which enables you to embed barcode reading functionality in your web, desktop, and mobile application. Its JavaScript Edition is browser-based and designed for web applications. With just a few lines of JavaScript code, you can develop a robust application to scan a linear barcode, QR Code, DataMatrix, and PDF417.

## How does the SDK Work
The front-end JavaScript library communicates with the back-end service. It is a part of Dynamsoft imaging and recognition modules. Developers only need to focus on the JavaScript APIs.
